Videogame project made by Bleeding Polygons, an eight people team. The team was composed by four programmers and four graphic dessigners, all of them students at ESAT university in Valencia, Spain.

This project was made as our final career project. The primary objective was to made a fully operational demo of a professional videogame, starting from scratch. All the project was built on Unreal Engine 4 and fmod. Perforce was used as source control and synchronization tool.

As part of the team, my work consisted in building all enemies artificial inteligence and specific behavior patterns for each one of them. Everything, from the AI controller to the perception components of the npc's was coded on C++ rather than builded on UE4 blueprints. This way we can ensure the AI responsiveness will be faster and more precise.
The AI also uses BehaviorTrees and the experimental Environment Query Systems offered by Unreal. This way, the bots movement is less predictable and has more realistic movement patterns.
Working on a project of this size was very challenging and interesting. In the end, I learned a lot from my companions and from the overall experience, and I hope to work on a similar project in the future.
